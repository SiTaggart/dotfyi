      While building platforms for the first time, your team and their customers
      go through a multitude of changes. Customers learn new ways to work and
      give up their own ways of working. And while most of these can be
      positive, inertia and muscle memory pose challenges that might be
      technical or operational, but almost always <strong>also</strong>{" "}
      cultural. We saw this as the{" "}

      was incubated and eventually scaled organization wide. Here are some of
      the ways we scaled our support, helping our customers and ourselves
      through these stages.

      Stage 1: Support as incubation
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      In 2018, we didn’t have a design system at Twilio. This meant that the
      most efficient way to express a UI solution involved copying older
      implementations and adopting popular code snippets and packages. In and of
      itself, this was fine: however, it did create situations where a UI
      compromise was necessary.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Since we were just incubating and weren't fully staffed or bought-in by
      the organization, we took small steps. One such step was the creation of a
      *help* slack channel. Here, no matter what your UI question was, we'd
      attempt to solve it. What's more, we wanted to solve it quickly. While
      this approach didn't allow for the best answer for each experience, it did
      allow us to take diving catches that built trust with designers, PMs, and
      engineers.

      Stage 2: Support as we scaled
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Fast forward about a year, and Paste was at the foot of a steep adoption
      curve. Unlike our legacy libraries (which had larger, more complex
      monolithic components), we had moved to an approach of small, accessible,
      and composable pieces that could be mixed and matched. Designers and
      engineers were beginning to use the system as a baseline for their UIs. In
      doing so, there was a lot of relearning and undoing of old habits. We
      started getting increasingly complex questions around accessibility,
      composition, UI reviews, and of course Typescript errors. We’d see upwards
      of 10 questions a day, and the team began to feel it.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This was a good problem to have: customers were buying in to the design
      system at a pace that was greater than anticipated. However, this meant
      that we were increasingly devoting more time to support rather than new
      development. This was affecting our development speed and, more
      importantly, team health: support is hard, and often a thankless job. To
      mitigate these problems, we investigated why our support model was failing
      at scale:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        The <strong>immediacy</strong> of Slack meant it was easier for people
        to get answers to their questions through a Slack message than go to the
        doc site to look for an answer.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Slack messages are ephemeral and teams around the world would routinely
        wake up to a host of new information that they’d just not see, leading
        to repeated questions.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        The quality of incoming requests was affected by the medium: “My build
        broke can you help?” instead of “My build (screenshot attached) failed,
        I am currently doing <em>x</em>, and tried to do <em>y</em>”
      </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      A change was necessary: we needed to evolve our discussions from "What's
      fast and cheap?" to "What's right?". To address the rising tide of support
      questions, the team stepped back from answering every question and made
      some changes:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>We improved documentation structure based on feedback</ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        We began a rotating helper model for the team to lead support
        conversations through the week
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        <strong>And a big change:</strong> We moved all support conversations
        from Slack to GitHub discussions.
      </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      This was a significant cultural change: moving the support model from
      Slack to a new platform was at the very least, a significant
      inconvenience. At worst, it was a breach of trust that the system was
      founded on. Managing how our users felt about this change was an important
      criteria for success. We’d need to inform people of the change, and then
      remind them of it enough till the habit was broken and remade. And we had
      to hope that in all of this, they still trusted us.

      How we announced it
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      We made the change official by announcing a new support model at an All
      Hands meeting. It was made alongside many positive announcements. That
      helped absorb the initial blow, but was also missed by quite a few folks.
      Keeping this change from unraveling meant we’d need to be persistent. We
      had to politely, but firmly say no to every request unless it came from
      the right channel. This also made it a <strong>feelings</strong>{" "}
      management problem: it was hard to have a team that had once routinely
      said <em>yes, and</em> to every request, now point to an external URL for
      any help.

    <Paragraph>
      We addressed new users first: using Slack’s workflow builder, I built a
      bot that DM’d anyone who joined our Slack channel for the first time with
      a greeting, important information, and a link to our support area. While
      this helped, we still had hundreds of people still active in the channel
      with a previous social contract.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To guide our existing customers, we built another bot: this one was a
      little less discrete. For every new question that showed up in Slack, it
      posted a response suggesting the user redirect this question to a support
      channel.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We sweated the details of this bot's message and tone. It had to be
      polite, sufficiently firm, and also provide reasons why we were making
      this change. For example, the bot responded to a slack reaction that's
      used company wide to indicate better documentation. We also included an
      escalation path for the truly rare request that needed urgent
      intervention: while the chances of hitting this button are extremely rare
      (given that our design system does not directly deploy to customers), it
      did give customers peace of mind in knowing that a short circuit still
      existed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We called this bot the <em>Paste Concierge</em>. It launched two months
      ago and we paid keen attention to how customers might react to it. As
      expected, the immediate response was less than optimal. While some
      customers (particularly engineers) took to the GitHub model easily, it
      took a while to convince others to sign up for GitHub just to engage with
      the system. We held firm with this new support model, and here’s what we’ve observed so far:
    </Paragraph>
    <OrderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Slack support requests have dropped from 10+ a day to 3 a week. Some of
        these are redirected to GitHub, but others are managed directly.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        GitHub discussions did <em>not</em> proportionally increase to 10+ a
        day. One hypothesis for this is that customers are more willing to try a
        few things out if the immediacy of Slack is not available.
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      It's important to note that perfect support is not realisting. The Paste Concierge clearly helped, but still needs more work. There’s still unanswered
      questions about design system support at Twilio. In the year ahead, we
      hope to:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Make support more conversational, and less transactional: each support
        question should influence the design and direction of the system.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Our conversations are still mostly <em>public DMs</em>, and not true
        discussions. This isn't ideal: like any design problem, involving
        diverse perspectives usually leads to better outcomes.

      The UX and UI that we ship is dynamic and changes with time. So should our
      support models. Healthy design systems respond to the world around them—
      whether it's making space to switch off when sheltered in place, time off
      for direct or political action, or surging for important deadlines like
      launches. In each of these cultural situations, consider the success of
      your support to not be about the answer itself, but the process in which
      your customer gets there, and how your team feels about it.
