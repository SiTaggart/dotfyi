    <Paragraph>
      Paste, a design system for Twilio’s customer experiences was launched in
      the second half of 2018. It was our fifth attempt at building a UI
      platform, and happened when Twilio was projecting revenue estimates of
      over half a million dollars. At the time, more than 2 million developers
      had used 25+ products at Twilio, each of which had their own versions of
      UI frameworks, and significant design patten drift.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      None of this is uncommon at the start of UI systemization, but the scale
      of the company definitely triggered some unique challenges. And while the
      expected problems of API design, tokenization, and component reviews were
      crucial tasks to kick off, we chose instead to focus on support.
    </Paragraph>
    <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">
      Why start with support?
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      I believe that at the heart of it, a good design system does two things
      effectively:
    </Paragraph>
    <OrderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Ensure that people feel like they have agency and involvement as their
        own hacks and workarounds are replaced with systemized paved paths.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Attenuate the thrash of constant change for teams, so they can trust
        they system and focus on delivery.
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      To put it brusquely, as a leader, design systems is change and feelings
      management. And supporting teams who may not have the space to consider
      the long-term journey of a platform team is critical to doing this right.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Support is crucial, and we did get it wrong early. A particularly low
      point in our journey early on, was when a delivery engineer reached out to
      understand how they may use the legacy component libraries to achieve a
      basic layout, and were deeply disappointed by how much friction there is
      to get something going. We definitely lost the trust of that engineer, and
      likely have to work a lot to regain that trust.
    </Paragraph>
    <Heading as="h2" variant="heading20">
      The different stages of support
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Good support systems scale dynamically with an ebb and flow that responds
      to team size, organizational events, and stages of adoption. Over three
      years, we’ve seen three decided shifts in how we support our customers.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Before we built Paste, the Design System team was about a 10% of my time
      as a Product Designer, and two contract engineers. At the time, I had an
      understanding of the benefits of a design system, but building was deep in
      the unfamiliar territory. Instead of building a new component system, we
      chose instead to establish ownership through support.
