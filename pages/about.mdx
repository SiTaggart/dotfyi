  Iâ€™m working at Twilio on building better products through design, and better design through systems.

  I care about helping people be their best selves, and being an ally to marginalized voices.I live in Oakland, CA with my two dogs: Thrace &amp; Tribbles.

  In an act of extreme dogfooding, this website is built using <Link href="//paste.twilio.design" passHref><Anchor>Paste</Anchor></Link>.
